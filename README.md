Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My journey in the world of Artificial Intelligence began with a spark of curiosity. From my first AI workshop, I've been on an exciting quest to explore the boundless possibilities of AI ever since.

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with a passion for building and deploying AI-driven solutions that solve complex, real-world problems. With a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and LLMs, I specialize in transforming data into actionable insights that empower smarter decisions and drive meaningful impact.

With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, data visualization, and cloud computing, coupled with experience in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch. I excel at building end-to-end AI solutions, from designing scalable data pipelines to deploying machine learning models in production. I have a particular interest in developing automated workflows, fine-tuning LLMs, and leveraging cloud platforms to optimize data processing and model deployment.

Collaborative and detail-oriented, I thrive in team settings where I can communicate complex concepts clearly and contribute to innovative solutions. Whether itâ€™s designing image processing pipelines, optimizing predictive models, or building end-to-end machine learning systems, Iâ€™m committed to pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. Iâ€™m always keen to learn new technologies and stay updated with advancements in AI to better tackle tomorrowâ€™s challenges.
